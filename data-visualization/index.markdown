Here are some examples of data visualization which I have done:

Here is shown various amounts of carbon dioxide which have either been released, can safely be released and that which remains still to be released. The chart then further breaks down the contribution of CO2 released yearly.

Two of the main variables to producing stable suspensions of particles are the amount of solids (actual material to be dispersed) and the level of dispersant. These two amounts must be carefully controlled to produce viable suspensions. Shown here are the results of approximately 80 trials of making aqueous composite LSM-YSZ suspensions. From our efforts we found the ideal conditions for dispersion (green area).

The coordination number is the number of nearest neighbors that a particle has. This chart illustrates where particles are packed most densely within a freeze-cast microstructure.

Normal distributions can be fit to describe macropore size within freeze-cast structures. This chart depicts how pore size decreases as freezing rate increases from 1 to 40 oC/min.
