# summarizeAccel(   )





* * *





## Overview



This is a function, written in R, which reads in raw data generated by the _Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set_ made available by UCI. This data contains information as read directly from the accelerometers and gyroscopes contained within Samsung smartphones. The script parses and summarizes the data into an easily read format ready for further use and/or analysis.

_Further information about can be found at [https://github.com/alichtner/](https://github.com/alichtner/getCleanData)_



## Usage



`summarizeAccel(a, b, ...)`



## Dependencies



`library(plyr)`



## Arguments



<table >

<tr >

<td >b

<td >list, containing machine-generated labels for each column variable and the human-readable variables to which they should be coerced.

## Details



To use this function, a raw data set from the UCI archive, usually in `.csv` format must be read into R using `read.csv()`. The function `summarizeAccel()` can then be called to convert the raw data into a form ready for use.

The final clean dataset generated by the function lists the averages for each acceleration vector (x, y, z) grouped by each subject and activity.

There are six activities for which the data will be grouped:





  1. Walking 


  2. Walking_Upstairs 


  3. Walking_Downstairs 


  4. Sitting 


  5. Standing 


  6. Laying





## Example Usage




    
    <code>library(plyr)
    cleanData <- summarizeAccel(rawData, names)
    </code>
